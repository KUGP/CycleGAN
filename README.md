# CycleGAN
CycleGAN_daytime_to_nighttime
## style transform using cycleGAN 
this is one of my graduate project 
we want to improve night time segmentation
but night time segmentation is difficult due to samll dataset (image,segmentation mask) 
so we use cycleGAN, transfer daytime image to night time image to train night time image with daytime image's segmentation mask 
this cycleGAN code from this [repo](https://github.com/hanyoseob/youtube-cnn-007-pytorch-cyclegan)

## converted image

this is input image from cityscapes dataset and segmentation mask 

this is input image from dark zurich 

this is output result
